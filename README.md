String Art GeneratorA powerful, browser-based tool that transforms any image into a beautiful and intricate string art pattern. This application not only generates a visual mockup but also provides a complete, step-by-step sequence of pin connections needed to create the artwork physically.FeaturesSelf-Contained: Runs entirely in your browser. No server or setup is required.Image-to-Art: Convert any uploaded JPG, PNG, or GIF into a detailed string art design.Intelligent Algorithm: Based on an "Intelligent Greedy" method that uses a perceptual error map (balancing image darkness and edge detection) to produce high-quality, recognizable results.Realistic Mockups: Specify the physical canvas size (in inches) and thread width (in mm) to generate a proportionally accurate preview of the final artwork.Complete Build Instructions: Automatically generates a single, continuous path that connects all the strings, providing a simple, numbered sequence of pins to follow.Downloadable Path: Download the final pin sequence as a .txt file for easy reference while building.How It WorksThe generator uses a sophisticated version of a greedy algorithm. Unlike basic methods, this "Intelligent Greedy" algorithm doesn't just look for the darkest areas.Perceptual Analysis: When an image is uploaded, the tool creates a "perceptual map." It analyzes the image for both contrast (dark areas) and definition (sharp edges, found using a Sobel filter).Weighted Decision-Making: At each step, the algorithm evaluates potential strings based on how much "perceptual improvement" they offer, considering both the need to fill in dark areas and the importance of defining key features.Sequential Path: It builds the artwork methodically, always moving from the last pin to the next best connection, which ensures a logical and continuous final path.This approach provides an excellent balance between speed and quality, producing great results without the long processing times of more complex global search algorithms.How to UseOpen index.html: Open the index.html file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).Upload Image: Click the "Upload Image" button and select a picture from your computer. Portraits or images with clear subjects work best.Adjust Parameters:Pins: The number of nails around the frame. More pins allow for more detail.Strings: The total number of lines to be drawn.Canvas Size & Thread Width: The physical dimensions of your project.Generate: Click the "Generate Artwork" button.Download: Once the generation is complete, the pin sequence will appear. Click the "Download Instructions" button to save it.Hosting on GitHub PagesYou can host this generator for free on the web using GitHub Pages.Create a GitHub Repository: Create a new, public repository on your GitHub account.Upload Files: Upload the index.html file and this README.md file to your new repository.Enable Pages:In your repository, go to Settings > Pages.Under "Build and deployment," select the source as "Deploy from a branch".Choose the main branch and the /(root) folder.Click "Save".Done! After a minute or two, your string art generator will be live at https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/.LicenseThis project is released into the public domain under the CC0 1.0 Universal license.
